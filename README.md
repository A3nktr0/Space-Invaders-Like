# Space Invaders Game (JavaScript)

Welcome to the Space Invaders game! This is a classic arcade-style game implemented in JavaScript. In this game, you will take control of a spaceship and defend the Earth from an alien invasion.

## Objective

Your objective is to shoot down all the invading aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. If any alien reaches the bottom, the game is over.

## Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship horizontally.
- Press the spacebar to shoot projectiles towards the aliens.

## Gameplay

The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty. In each level, a fleet of aliens will move horizontally across the screen, gradually descending towards your spaceship. Your spaceship can move left and right to avoid the alien projectiles and to position yourself for better shots.

You can shoot projectiles towards the aliens to destroy them. If your projectile hits an alien, it will be destroyed, and you will earn points. The aliens will also shoot projectiles towards your spaceship, so be careful and dodge them to avoid losing a life.

As you progress through the levels, the aliens will move faster and their formations will become more challenging. Some aliens may also have special abilities, such as shooting multiple projectiles.

## Scoring

- Destroying an alien: Earns you points.

## Game Over

The game is over when all your lives are lost or when an alien reaches the bottom of the screen.
